Custom library for use with Sparkfun Pro RF LoRa module

Abstracts away the RH_RFM95.h library and defines custom message types for receiving and sending between the base and nodes.


Information from example Arduino library:
After a successful build of this library, a new file named "Test.o" will appear
in "Arduino/lib/targets/libraries/Test". This file is the built/compiled library
code.

If you choose to modify the code for this library (i.e. "Test.cpp" or "Test.h"),
then you must first 'unbuild' this library by deleting the "Test.o" file. The
new "Test.o" with your code will appear after the next press of "verify"
